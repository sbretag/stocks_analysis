# Stocks-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background & Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor the original VBA script put together to analyze stocks found in Steve's parents portfolio. The original workbook prepared for Steve contained a VBA script that analyzed a dozen stocks looping through the entire data set per each stock.  Steve is looking to expand his reserach so he can analyze more stocks in an efficient manner.  The original script needs to be refactored in a way that the entire stock market can be analyzed if necessary using one loop versus looping throw the entire data set for each stock.  A final determination needs to be reached on whether the refactored script performed more efficiently than the original script all the while confirming the new output still matches the original output.
