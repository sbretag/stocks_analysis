# Stocks-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose & Background

The purpose of this project is to refactor code that was previously written for Steve who is analyzing stocks for his parent's portfolio.  The original code is set to look at specific stocks and it needs to be refactored to analyze the entire stock market if necessary.  The original code was set up to look at a dozen specific stocks and loop throw all rows for each stock looking for the matching stock symbol.  The refactored code needs to be altered to incorporate a stock index number which will allow for only having to loop through the entire data set once. The end goal of the project and analysis is to confirm there was no change in the output between the original and refectored script in addition to measuring and comparing the execution times between each.
