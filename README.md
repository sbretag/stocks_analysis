# Stocks-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background & Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor the original VBA script put together to analyze stocks found in Steve's parents portfolio.  The new script should be refactored in a way that the entire stock market can be analyzed if necessary using one loop versus looping throw the entire data set for each stock.  A final determination will be made on whether the refactored script performed more efficiently than the original script while confirming the output still matches the original output.
